# The operator iterates on this UI visually and cannot otherwise see it while a change
# is being made: a polish problem at one width stays invisible until somebody starts
# the app by hand at that width. This runs the browser tier's own fixture server and
# Vite stack (`apps/dag-ui/screenshots.config.ts` reuses `playwright.config.ts`, which
# chooses free ports and a fixture directory per run), so two of these at once is two
# independent stacks — and the gallery directory is made here, per invocation, for the
# same reason: the one thing the Playwright configs do not already keep apart.
#
# The gallery is named exactly once, by whichever ending the run reaches: the path on
# success, and on failure the same path alongside what went wrong — so a capture that
# died part way through still says where its partial images are.
