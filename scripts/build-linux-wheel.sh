# Build the `onepipeline-api-cli` wheel for one Linux target inside the
# manylinux image the release publishes it from.
#
# This is the one definition of a Linux wheel build: release.yml's Linux
# `build-wheels` legs and ci.yml's `wheel` legs both run it through `just
# wheel-linux`, so a pull request builds under the image, prerequisites and
# maturin invocation a release does. v0.16.0 is why: every required check passed
# on the change that linked onetaskgraph's HTTP stores, and the first place their
# vendored OpenSSL met this image was the release, which then published no wheel.
#
# The prerequisites: `openssl-sys` is built with its vendored feature (the
# engine's linked onetaskgraph stores reach `reqwest` with native TLS vendored),
# which compiles OpenSSL from source, and OpenSSL 3's `Configure` loads Perl
# modules the image's CentOS 7 Perl leaves out.
#
# The binary embeds the browser view (`--features bundled-ui`, see build.rs), so
# `just build` must have written apps/dag-ui/dist first; the container only
# reads it.
#
# The build runs as root in the container, because installing those modules
# does; what it writes into the checkout is handed back to the invoking user on
# the way out, pass or fail. A target whose architecture is not the host's runs
# under whatever emulation Docker has — the release's legs are native.
#
# Usage:
#   build-linux-wheel.sh --target TRIPLE [--out DIR]
#
# DIR is relative to the repository root, which is what the container mounts,
# and must resolve inside it. Exit 0: the wheel is in DIR. Exit 2: the arguments
# were refused. Exit 1: the build or its environment failed, named on stderr.
