/**
 * Every major surface of the DAG Observatory, captured at every viewport in the
 * matrix, against the same fixture server and Vite stack the browser e2e drives.
 *
 * This tier asserts almost nothing on purpose: it is the operator's eyes. Polish
 * problems — a column that crowds its neighbour, a panel clipped at one width, a
 * control that has nowhere to go — are invisible to an assertion that was never
 * written for them, and until now the only way to see one was to start the app by
 * hand at each size. The waits below are what make a capture worth looking at: each
 * surface is photographed once its real reads have landed, never mid-skeleton.
 *
 * `screenshots.config.ts` selects this file and nothing else; `just dag-ui-screens`
 * is how it runs, and the gallery it writes is per invocation so two operators (or
 * two agents) capturing at once do not overwrite each other's images.
 */

/**
 * Where this run writes its images, as `just dag-ui-screens` named it.
 *
 * The recipe makes the directory and passes it in, which is what lets it print the path
 * before Playwright has said anything and what keeps two concurrent captures apart.
 * `scripts/dag-ui-screens.sh` is the only source of that path — this tier refuses to
 * run without it rather than inventing a second place galleries can land, and the path
 * has to be absolute because a relative one would scatter images wherever the process
 * happened to start.
