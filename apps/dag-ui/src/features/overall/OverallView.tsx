/**
 * The run as a whole, read as one clock rather than as a list of its parts.
 *
 * There are three linked levels here and each is one click from the next. The graph
 * timeline collapses to a single line — what the run has spent its life on, silence
 * included — opens into one row per node beside the run's own driving sessions, and
 * each of those rows opens again into the category lanes the node view draws. Every
 * row is plotted on one controlled range, so zooming any of them zooms all of them and
 * a column always means the same instant however deep the reader is.
 *
 * There is deliberately no time cursor at this level: a cursor locks a plot to a
 * position in a stream being read beside it, and a graph is many streams at once.
