 * Gather each onejudge dispatch's sessions under the agent session that opened it.

 * One dispatch is an agent conversation plus the judge that supervised it and the
 * lint run it made of its own work — three oneharness sessions an operator has to be
 * able to read as one unit, and which three sibling rows of equal weight hid.
 *
 * The identity comes from what the server records about each session. A lint session
 * is already served nested inside the dispatch it ran under, so it arrives as a child.
 * A judge session is served as a sibling, and the dispatch it belongs to is the agent
 * session it is supervising — the most recent one opened in the same scope, which is
 * exactly the pairing onejudge produces. Schema 10 serves that identity outright as
 * `dispatch_id`; this recovers the same grouping from what schema 9 records.
