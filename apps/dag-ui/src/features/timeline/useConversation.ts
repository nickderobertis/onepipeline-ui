 * wholesale: the timeline names each session by id, and this reads the one the
 * operator opened. Selecting another moment of the same session changes nothing here,
 * so stepping through a conversation's turns costs one read, not one per turn.
 *
 * `record` is what the served timeline says this session has recorded — its state, its
 * end, and its turns. It is the whole revalidation rule: a live session's record moves
 * as turns land and this re-reads it, while a session that has stopped recording keeps
 * one record forever and is never read again, however busy the rest of the run is.
 * Reads are stale-while-revalidate — the transcript already served stays until the
 * next one arrives, and a revalidation that fails leaves it in place rather than
 * replacing a readable page with an error.
