 * and the two are read in the same vocabulary so a reader moving between them is not
 * learning a second one. Its rows are the graph's own: the run-level sessions that
 * drive it, then one per plan node. Every row is plotted on one shared range, so the
 * columns of a row mean the same instants as the columns of the row above it.
 *
 * The gaps are the point. A run's wall time is mostly not work — a node waits on a
 * dependency, a graph waits on a person, a driver waits on a provider — and a plot
 * that leaves those stretches blank cannot be told from one whose record is missing.
