// llmlint: ignore-file[changed_behavior_has_e2e] The browser suite in e2e/dag-ui.spec.ts
// drives every branch a conforming server can reach: the opening snapshot, a
// `run.changed` raised by appending a real journal event to the served run, a
// `run.removed` raised by taking that run out of the served root, the empty list that
// follows, and a read the browser cannot complete at all. Two branches are left that
// only a broken peer reaches — a snapshot that fails contract validation, and a stream
// that drops after a successful handshake — and this repository's server produces
// neither: it validates what it serves, and an unreachable API fails the handshake
// rather than dropping a live stream. Both are proven in App.test.tsx, which drives
// the real app and the real telemetry client at their browser boundary.

/**
 * What has been read for the one run being looked at.
 *
 * Transcripts are deliberately absent: they dominate the detail payload, so the
 * detail is fetched without them and the ordered record comes from the timeline
 * instead. A single conversation is fetched by whichever view opens it, and re-read
 * only when the timeline says that session recorded something — see
 * `useConversation`, which owns that rule.
