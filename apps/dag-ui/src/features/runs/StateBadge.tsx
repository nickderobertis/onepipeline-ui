/**
 * A run or node state, in the orchestrator's own words and the design system's own
 * semantic colours.
 *
 * The package ships `StatusBadge`, and it is the right component wherever the state
 * really is one of the four it knows — a conversation's, for one. A run or a node is
 * not: the ledger settles a node as `done` and a run as `complete`, holds a human
 * action at `waiting`, and abandons work as `cancelled`. `StatusBadge` renders an
 * unrecognized state with no tone at all, so passing these through would leave a
 * finished run and an abandoned one looking alike, and relabelling them to fit its
 * vocabulary would replace the word the ledger actually recorded. Mapping instead
 * keeps both: the recorded word, and a colour that means something.
