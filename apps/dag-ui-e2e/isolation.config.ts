 * The one check that runs the browser tier rather than being run by it.
 *
 * `playwright.config.ts` chooses that tier's ports and fixture directory per run, and
 * every ordinary run exercises that choice; only two overlapping runs exercise what
 * it is for. So this config starts no servers and opens no browser — its spec launches
 * two real runs of the other config at once and asserts they stayed out of each other's
 * way. It is deliberately a separate config: a spec living under the tier's own
 * `testDir` would inherit the environment recording that run's choice, and the runs it
 * launched would reuse it instead of choosing their own.
